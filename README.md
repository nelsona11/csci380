# How To Use
Change the WiFi and Losant credentials to your own. Upload the accelerometer.ino code to the accelerometer device. Upload the
light.ino code to the device containing the led light. Provide power to them and wait for them to connect. When they do
hit whatever the accelerometer is attached to and watch the light turn on.
